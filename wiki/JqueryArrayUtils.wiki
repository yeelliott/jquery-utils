== Introduction ==

Provide additional functional method to work with array. This library is largely inspired by the [http://www.prototypejs.org/api/enumerable enumerables] concept in the [http://www.prototypejs.org/ Prototype Javascript Library].

== Methods ==

|| *Method* || *Returns* || *Descriptions* ||
|| `$.all` || `boolean` || Determines whether all the elements are boolean-equivalent to true, either directly or through computation by the provided iterator ||
|| `$.any` || `boolean` || Determines whether at least one element is boolean-equivalent to true, either directly or through computation by the provided iterator ||
|| `$.detect` || `mixed` || Finds the first element for which the iterator returns true ||
|| `$.eachSlice` || `array` || Groups items in chunks based on a given size, with last chunk being possibly smaller ||
|| `$.inject` || `number` || Incrementally builds a result value based on the successive results of the iterator. This can be used for array construction, numerical sums/averages, etc ||
|| `$.invoke` || `array` || Invokes the same method, with the same arguments, for all items in a collection. Returns the results of the method calls ||
|| `$.max` || `array` || Returns the maximum element (or element-based computation), or false if the enumeration is empty. Elements are either compared directly, or by first applying the iterator and comparing returned values ||
|| `$.min` || `array` || Returns the minimum element (or element-based computation), or false if the enumeration is empty. Elements are either compared directly, or by first applying the iterator and comparing returned values ||
|| `$.partition` || `array` || Partitions the elements in two groups: those regarded as true, and those considered false. By default, regular JavaScript boolean equivalence is used, but an iterator can be provided, that computes a boolean representation of the elements. ||
|| `$.partition` || `array` || Partitions the elements in two groups: those regarded as true, and those considered false. By default, regular JavaScript boolean equivalence is used, but an iterator can be provided, that computes a boolean representation of the elements. ||
|| `$.pluck` || `array` || Fetch the same property for all the elements and returns the property values ||
|| `$.reject` || `array` || Returns all the elements for which the iterator returned false ||
|| `$.select` || `array` || Returns all the elements for which the iterator returned true ||
|| `$.sum` || `number` || Returns the sum of a given array ||
|| `$.zip` || `array` || Zips together 2 sequences, providing an array of tuples. Each tuple contains one value per original sequence. Tuples can be converted to something else by applying the optional iterator on them. ||

== Complementary methods ==

These methods are available with jQuery core.

|| *Method* || *Returns* || *Descriptions* ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.each $.each] || `array` || A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.find $.find] || `array` || Searches for all elements that match the specified expression. This method is a good way to find additional descendant elements with which to process ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.grep $.grep] || `array` || Filter items out of an array, by using a filter function ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.inArray $.inArray] || `number` || Determine the index of the first parameter in the Array (-1 if not found) ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.merge $.merge] || `array` || Merge two arrays together. Removing all duplicates is removed in jQuery 1.1.3 ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.map $.map] || `array` || Translate all items in an array to another array of items ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/slice#startend $.slice] || `array` || Selects a subset of the matched elements ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.unique $.unique] || `array` || Remove all duplicate elements from an array of elements ||
|| [http://docs.jquery.com/Utilities/jQuery.size $.size] || `number` || Return the size of a collection or an array ||
